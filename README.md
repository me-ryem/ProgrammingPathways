# 💻 Programming Pathways 💻

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning journey in **Python** and **C++**!

## Me? ⬇️
My name is **Maryam**, an aspiring programmer from Pakistan with a keen interest in **cybersecurity** and **web development**. This repository serves as a record of my progress, projects, and resources as I learn Python and C++.

## Why? 🎯
- **Master Python** with a focus on applications in cybersecurity and web development.
- **Gain proficiency in C++** using DS Malik's 7th edition book as a guide.
- **Document my learning process** by writing programs in both languages, ensuring that for every program I write in one language, I also implement it in the other.
- **Utilize ChatGPT** to understand concepts and solve practice problems, enhancing my learning experience.

## What? 📂
- **`python/`**: Contains lessons, exercises, and projects related to Python, especially focused on cybersecurity and web development.
- **`cpp/`**: Contains lessons, exercises, and projects related to C++, guided by DS Malik's 7th edition.

## How? 📖
Here are some resources I’m using to learn:
- [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)
- [DS Malik, 7th Edition: C++ Programming](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-7th-D.S.-Malik/dp/1439049987)
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) for understanding concepts and practice problems.

## Adrenaline ⚡
My primary motivation for learning these languages is to equip myself with the necessary skills to contribute effectively in the field of cybersecurity. I aim to use my programming skills for both **offensive** and **defensive** security, enabling me to develop secure applications and tools that can combat cyber threats from all angles.
