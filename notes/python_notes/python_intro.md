# Overview

- Python has a clean, readable syntax that emphasizes simplicity and reduces the need for boilerplate code.
- Dynamically typed, allowing variable types to be determined at runtime. This leads to faster coding and flexibility but may result in runtime errors if types are not handled carefully.
- Uses automatic memory management with garbage collection. This simplifies coding but can introduce overhead and less control over memory usage.
- Slower because it is interpreted at runtime. It trades performance for ease of use and rapid development. Often used in web development, data analysis, and scripting.
- Supports OOP but is more flexible with its approach. Supports multiple inheritance and has a more intuitive syntax for defining classes and methods. This will be explained in detail later.
- Widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and scripting tasks.
- Known for its simplicity and readability, making it easier for beginners to learn. It has a large and active community with extensive documentation and resources.
