# Overview

- C++ syntax is more complex and verbose, requiring *semicolons to end statements* and *curly braces to define code blocks*.
- Statically typed, meaning variable types must be *declared explicitly* at compile time. This can lead to more optimized code but requires more lines of code to manage types.
- Provides *manual memory management* with features like pointers and dynamic allocation. This offers fine control over resources but increases the risk of memory leaks and errors.
- Generally *faster* due to being compiled to machine code and having *more control over hardware resources*. Ideal for performance-critical applications, such as game engines and system software.
- Fully supports OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Allows multiple inheritance and operator overloading. This will be explained in detail later on.
- Commonly used in *system programming, game development, performance-critical applications, embedded systems*, and *applications where hardware control is necessary*.
